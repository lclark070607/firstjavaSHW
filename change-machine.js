//Imagine we have a very versatile change machine. 
//Create a variable called amount stores a quantity of dollars, 
//and write some code that produces an array 
//that indicates the number of 1, 5, 10, and 20 bills 
//that the change machine should return. 
//You want the change machine to return the smallest number of bills possible.


//After your code runs you should have a new array of the format 
//[twenties, tens, fives, ones]. 
//For example, if amount = 47, you should print an array 
//after your code runs that looks like [2, 0, 1, 2] 
//(two twenties, 0 tens, 1 five, 2 ones).
